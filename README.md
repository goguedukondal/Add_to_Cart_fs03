In this Project I have used react hooks like useEffect for handling side Effects like axios, with axios I am fetching data from fakestoreAPI end point.
I have also used useState for managing current state. After data fetched from API i assigned particular data to the state variable.
I have used ContextAPI concept to store data from components and to provide data to all the components .
I have used react-router-dom which is third party library for dynamically changing(routing) Components.
I have used ChakraUI which is third party Library for designing Components.
I have used map method for mapping on array and i have used filter method for filtering on array in the case deleting particular product from Cart.
